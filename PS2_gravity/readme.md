Running the makefile in the code folder will replicate all the results. The makefile in the writeup folder, however, will not produce the exact PDF as additional notes and comments were added on the tables post development.


I use the following Julia 1.6, R 3.6 and Stata 15.1 MP. Each do files notes the additional packages that you might need to replicate the results.
